# By Your Bootstraps

### Introduction

Today we'll be making a version of our portfolio with as many html elements turned into Bootstrap components as possible. You'll be surprised to see what Bootstrap can do!


### Steps

1. Fork any of your portfolio repos you want. [A refresher on forking a repo.](https://github.com/abbreviatedman/go-fork-yourself)
2. Add the Bootstrap css link from the [Getting Started section of the Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/).
3. Replace every interface element that could be replaceable by a Bootstrap component with that component. Be sure to check the [Bootstrap Components docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/) _thoroughly_. You should be able to put close to 100% of your content within a BS component.


### Guidelines

* You absolutely can (and should) keep any flexbox or grid or other layout system code. This project is about adding Bootstrap _components_, not replacing our layout system. (Yet. We'll be doing Grid Layout on Monday.)
